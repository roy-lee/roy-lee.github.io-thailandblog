1st attempt at trying out ReactJS + GatsbyJS + Github Pages for blogging!

1. [Gatsby Documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)
2. [Gatsby Starter Blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog)
3. [Gatsby with Github Pages](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/)

Gatsby purely uses markdown for blog posts.

CSS Styles are used too, of course. But that is a concern for another day.
