1st attempt at trying out ReactJS + GatsbyJS + Github Pages for blogging!

1. <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gatsby Documentation</a>
2. <a href="https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gatsby Starter Blog</a>
3. <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gatsby with Github Pages</a>

Gatsby purely uses markdown for blog posts.

CSS are used too, of course. But that is a concern for another day.

For now, a simple blogging platform would do.
