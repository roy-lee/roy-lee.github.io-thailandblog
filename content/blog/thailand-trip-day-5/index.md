Today marks the last day of the Bangkok solo trip. Got plenty of rest by sleeping in till late morning. Went down to grab a quick breakfast before heading back to finalise the packing of my luggage. Checked out at 12pm and called for a Grab Taxi. Waited for more than half and hour because my place was not convenient and drivers had to go another round just to U-turn to my place.

Boarded the taxi and headed for the airport. Didn't take the toll road to save 50 baht. The taxi ride took about almost an hour. Tipped the driver the 50 baht when I got off at the airport. As it was still early for my flight (4 hours away), I went around Terminal 1 and 2 to take a look. Been here almost 3 times but didn't get the chance to take a look around.

They have some interesting mini cafes, food courts and McDonalds (yikes). Went to have lunch at one of the food courts. Fried fish spaghetti was on the menu. It was okay. Not very exciting as compared to other food I had in the previous days. Walked around and went into a mini cafe to chill and wait for my flight. Ordered a cuppacino and used my laptop for 2 hours, until 4pm.

Went to check in my baggage afterwards and waited at the departure area. Flight was at 6pm amd I sat down and wait. When time was approaching, we received news that the flight had been delayed. The flight before ours was delayed and it ate into our timing. It was delayed multiple times, amounting to a total time of about 2 hours. I had a couple of beers in between and got slightly lightheaded/tipsy. Funny how I go into the plane slightly high. Boarded the plane and it was a smooth ride back. The journey felt shorter than I had anticipated. I was sitting on the window seat. So it was kinda awkward for me to go to the toilet as I have to ask 2 person before me to get up. Adding the fact that the person sitting near the isle was having dinner on his seat. So I waited for my opportunity but it was far too long. I whipped out my phone and watch "Alita : Battle Angel" (again) and the plane touched down even before halfway through the movie.

Grabbed my bag and went straight to DFS to get some wine for my parents. Collected my luggage and got into my dad's car (thanks dad). Had a chat about my trip while going back home. I asked and checked if everything was alright at home too. All's good and this is the finale for 2019 Bangkok solo trip.

Upcoming trip in August would be to Japan. It's a school trip and it will be my first time there. Gonna be fun (I hope)! Till next time!
