1. Got to the airport early.
2. Bought SIM card in the plane! (EXTREMELY CONVENIENT for 299Baht!!)
3. Forgot that Singaporean passport still need to fill up immigration card. Passed the opportunity while on the plane (YIKES). Could have shaved off about 10-15mins.
4. Took a Grab to accomodation.
5. Place is nice but soap ran out and there's a couple of annoying mosquitoes (YIKES).
6. Preparation for Chatuchak weekend market later!

Just a quick and dirty draft. More pictures will come again later!

For now, nights.
