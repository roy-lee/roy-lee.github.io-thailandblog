Woke up early today and did the laundry. The weather here is absolutely perfect for drying clothes. Even the jeans were dried by afternoon.

Moving forward, I took a train to Sukhumvit in search of a burger place named "Daniel Thaiger". The long walk coupled with the hot sun is certainly not the best combination. What's worst is I came out empty handed for the first time. No water bottle, no bag, no nothing. So it was kinda risky because one might get a heatstroke anytime.

Walked about 15-20 mins to reach the restaurant. The ambience is pretty chill and the drinks menu is rather interesting. Most importantly, I felt that the burger was pretty decent.

>The upside is that the burger taste great and hits the right spots. The downside is that the portion was small.

But it is somewhat better than your average burger you'd have elsewhere. The price is about 365 baht after taxes. So if you're prepared to pay about $15 SGD for a single burger, you can consider this outlet.

Proceeded to get my bottle of water in the nearest convenient store. Please, please, please do remember to hydrate yourself because the water loss throughout your journey cannot be underestimated! I cannot understand how some people can wear a jacket and walk long distances under this kind of weather. Won't your insides be cooked??? But you do you. I just cannot wrap this around me head.

Wanted to take a taxi and go back to Sukhumvit MRT but decided to walk instead. Remember, 15 mins walk to your destination is also a 15 mins walk back if you're going by foot. So if you're going with a partner, make sure both of y'all can take it.

It was a good call to walk as I found the massage place that I was searching for on Day 1. The place is called Health Land. It's an extremely clean place for massage. The prices are slightly above average compared to those outlets on the streets.

I got changed and proceeded with the 1 hour massage. It was very relaxing and I actually fell asleep midway. The masseur was great with his techniques and gave me some advices too. It was certainly worth the trip to Health Land. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for legit massage in Bangkok. Will come here again and try the more expensive package next time!

Once the massage was over, I walked to Sukhumvit MRT and took a train to Thailand Cultural Center. Destination in mind was Ratchada Rot Fai Train Night Market. I walked past Esplanade shopping mall and decided to take a look inside. Its your everyday shopping mall, but larger. There's a cinema upstairs and I was really tempted to watch Avengers: Endgame. The subtitles were in Thai, so that's the only bummer for me. Will go back to Singapore and watch it with my parents instead!

Went to the night market in early evening. Quite a few stalls weren't even open yet. I managed to explore some places that were unexplored the last time I was here. Could have sworn I went around the market at least 3 times. The prices of the goods there are some what similar to Chatuchak (surprise surprise). One notable item to lookout for if you're getting Havaianas flip flops, you can get it here for 199 baht. I got mine at 220 (discounted from 250) baht in Chatuchak. I bought 4 pairs over there. Could have saved myself 80 baht (that's like 1 more street food to eat) if I held off my purchase in the weekend market! Lesson learnt I suppose. In the future, I'd get my flip flops fix over there in Ratchada Rot Fai Train Night Market.

Had Banana Chocolate Roti and a fish stick for dinner! I didn't go for the seafood platter this time because I wasn't that hungry and the portion looks a bit too much for 1 person. If you're travelling with a partner, please go ahead and try their seafood platter! The Banana Chocolate Roti is also quite fulling. So I'd recommend having it after your main course for dinner.

At the back of the night market, there lies a stretch of bars. Pretty much like what you'd see in Singapore Punngol. Double story, open space concept bar. Prices of liquor there are decent. I did not went for a drink there today because I still had a bottle of whiskey back at my place which I have yet to finish (and tomorrow is flight day). Bought a shirt there and took a train back shortly.

Once I'm back in my comfort zone, I started to pack my luggage. I made sure every loot manage to fit into my luggage and my backpack. It was a good call to bring my military assault pack instead of a "look good" travel bag. I know some people like to travel in style, and I would too. But practically speaking, travelling in style probably means minimalistic and clean look. Which is not ideal if you're hoarding.

Once I've got everything packed up, it was pretty much chill night for me. Went to the nearest convenience store and got myself 2 bags of chips. Put on my trusty Bose QC35 headphones, drink some (all) whiskey, eat some chips, watch some movies/videos. It was a very enjoyable time. I also realised a full mini bottle (200cl) of whiskey (Chivas Regal) neat is probably my limit. Anything more than this and I'd be in server 2. Must be getting on with age.

Overall, had an extremely free and easy day today. Prepared to check-out of my accomodation tomorrow at 12pm and head to the airport! Safe flight to myself!
