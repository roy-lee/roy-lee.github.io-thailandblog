Woke up and walked around the accomodation vicinity in search for breakfast. Yea, it might sound crazy I know, but this is my first time walking in the opposite direction of the train station in 3 days.

Found a small store selling meatball noodles and grabbed one of the beef bowl for 50 Baht. The taste was pretty decent,albeit the portion was a bit small (just slightly bigger than the Boat Noodle I had near Victory Monument on Day 1). Grabbed a Cha Yen (Milk Tea) with pearl for 25 Baht and called a Grab to head to the Grand Palace.

During the taxi ride, the driver recommended me to go to Wat Pho instead for 3 reasons.

1. The weather is extremely hot.
2. It is a hotspot for tourist, so I'll probably need to queue for a long while.
3. The entrance fee is about 400-500 baht.
4. It closes at 3pm.
I was also told that if I really want to, I can visit the Grand Palace after touring Wat Pho Temple!
So I did and went to Wat Pho first instead. There were quite some tourists but the queue is almost non-existent because the entrance ticket is 200 baht and you can proceed right in without bag check.

The interior of the temple looks great! There were plenty of Monk/Buddha statues. The buildings and architectures are unique and beauty! Makes you wonder how did they do it and the significance behind them. Well, if you want to, you can probably pay a couple of hundred bahts for a tour guide, or simply enjoy and appreciate the beauty of those artifacts in the moment and Google it at your free time. (Yes I went in blindly not knowing what to expect.)

Deep inside the temple lies the world largest reclining Buddha.
Extract from Wikipedia:
> A reclining Buddha is a statue that represents Buddha lying down and is a major iconographic and statuary pattern of Buddhism.It represents the historical Buddha during his last illness, about to enter the parinirvana.
Inside here, you'll need to take your shoes and put it in a plastic bag provided. Inside this hall you can see the enormous statue of the reclining Buddha stretching from head to toe. I did not have any dedicated camera with me to capture this beauty, so I just had to do with my trusty OnePlus 6.

**Be prepared for spoilers if you have yet to travel there before!! This is my own experience, takeaway and lesson from the following activity. If you want to experience it on your own, skip the below!**

One activity to do inside this hall was "Coin Dropping". You simply have to pay 20 baht and the staff will pass you a bowl full of coins.

You need to drop those coins into the many bowls which stretched across the length of the hall. How you provision your coins to each bowl was entirely up to you. Again, as I mentioned, I went in blindly, not knowing what to expect.

So initially, I grabbed a couple of coins at the start and dropped them into the first bowl. I did that because I looked at my bowl of coins and compared it with all the bowls in the hall and thought to myself: "There's plenty of coins enough for all of the bowls in this hall."

And then this is where the fun begins. The satisfying sound of the coins dropping into the bowl, the action of dropping those coins, it was quite fun to me! It's like a "touristy" thing one would do over there. But as I gradually reach the bowl in the middle of the stretch, I realised, my coins were not sufficient for the rest of the journey. I switched from my dropping "a couple of coins" to "2 coins per bowl".

It was an improvement. I can last a few more bowls than what I could do with my previous method. But as I reach towards the end of my journey, I realised I did not have enough coins for the remaning bowls. So I switched from "2 coins per bowl" to just 1 coin each. It was a futile attempt. I did not successfully complete the entire coin journey. There were some bowls at the end which I did not put any coins into.

I was enlightened by this simple activity. Imagine that those stretch of bowls is a journey of a job/project/work. And those coins which I had initially was my effort. Now, initially, everything is fun and exciting because it is a fresh project. There are so many things to explore and do. So I put in a lot of effort at the start. Towards the middle of the project, I realised that I overestimated my efforts and it's becoming very draining. I can't go on like this all the way.

So by putting lesser and lesser effort, I thought I could complete the journey. But this turns out to be wrong. The lesson was never about putting lesser and lesser effort. The lesson is to look ahead, plan ahead, provision your efforts with estimates, don't overdo things at the start only to crumble towards the end. It should go off with a bang(putting your remaning coins into the last bowl) instead of reducing your efforts towards the end(1 coin per bowl).

This coin dropping acitivty was simple yet enlightening. At least for me. This was my own experience and I hope you had tried this activity and come up with your own conclusion before reading mine. If not, well, it's a free lesson then!

After finishing this activity, I went around taking photos and exited the temple shortly. Remember to drink plenty of water as the weather is extremely hot. For those people who intend to travel alone as well, take note that if you faint, no one trustable will be beside you. You'll be a very easy prey to someone who have malicious intent.

The above was a very gentle reminder by the taxi driver who shot me the question while I was going there.

After visiting Wat Pho, I wanted to visit the Grand Palace. So I followed the huge stretch of wall surrounding the palace and headed to the entrance. As I was approaching the entrace, a local tuktuk driver came up to me and asked where I was going. I told him I was heading to Grand Palace and he immediately told me it was close. I looked at my watch and realised it was 3pm already. The palace is closed. What a bummer. He offered me to visit 2 other locations but I have no intentions of go to those places.

So I walked towards On Lok Yun from Wat Pho(as recommended by the previous taxi driver). It was about 10-15 minutes walk under the hot sun so I recommend wearing a hat and shades if you have it with you. Water is a must. Keep your eyes peeled for vehicles(especially those who are travelling alone). The culture and traffic flow there is not as structured as Singapore.

Upon reaching On Lok Yun, I took a look at the menu and found out they serve brunch sets! Bacon, ham, eggs and saugages! I ordered one of those and it was really pretty good. I mean, there's no WOW factor for me, but I can say at least say it's pretty good, especially if you're taking a break from long walks and the scorching hot sun. I was told this is a common place for tourist especially Singaporeans See? I went in blindly again. This trip was supposed to be a free and easy and carefree trip, and it sure is!

After eating the brunch set, I called a Grab and went to Pratunam. Lesson for me: double check your GPS location if you copy and pasted your location from Google! If traffic jam wasn't bad enough, the GPS auto-corrected the location to another place(might be based on postal code). So the journey took about 20 minutes extra for me to reach Pratunam.

When I reached there, first thing I did was to buy a shirt. My current shirt has been stained with sweat (eww) from the temple visit and the hot sun. I could have went back to my accomodation and get changed but I'd probably be too lazy to come out again.

Went to change into the new shirt immediately after purchasing. Went to the 3 common shopping places around that area.

1. Pratunam Market
2. Platinum Shopping Mall
3. Palladium IT Pratunam (Mall)

Took a looksie and walked around for a bit but did not buy anything because most stuffs are for girls and I did my shopping on Day 1 at Chatuchak. Most of the things there, like I said previously, are repetitive. Even the prices are too. But you can try to bargain and see if you can get your goods for lower. When I came out of the mall, it was already dark. So I walked towards Talad Neon Night Market.

Over here at Talad Neon Night Market, there are plenty of food stalls and small shops. I went to grab a plate of pork ribs and a rice to settle for dinner. It was pretty okay. Ordered a Cha Yen and sat down to rest. Walked the market for a bit and decided to go back.

Intersting fact:
Grab Bike(Win) is actually GrabBike(Almost-win). Reason?
There is no auto direct translation + sending of photos in the Grab Bike chat with drivers. Grab Car/Taxi have the ability to receive translated Thai to English texts on the go and photos of your surroundings.

So I'm guessing you can say, "cant you just Google translate his texts in your browser/app?"
Yes I did. But all the driver kept replying was "send me a picture" I told him I could not because there was no such function. He then proceeded to say I lied to him and people will hurt me(in Google translate). Safe to say he already got my accomodation address and could be waiting for me downstairs(I even gave him a description of what I was wearing). I told him I'm sorry for wasting his time and I'll cancel it.

Well, to be fair, I honestly did nothing wrong and have everything to prove if he comes at me. But lucky me, when I took another Grab(taxi this time) back, there were no one in the dark alley(must be thanks to the temple visit earlier in the day, heh). The difference in price between GrabTaxi and GrabBike is about 50 baht.

Went back and took a nice shower and break before calling it a day! Will be doing laundry tomorrow to lessen the load back home!
